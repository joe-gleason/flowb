flowb [Flow builder]

   A FLOW consists of 1 or more STAGEs
   A STAGE consists of 1 or more TASKs
   A TASK is an item that executes (i.e. script)

   Returns a non-zero exit code if any task fails

[File Structure]

   bin/
      flowb.py                   Python executable
      flowb                      Symlink to python executable
      flowb.sh                   Allows for sourcing of profile/ files before executing

   config/
      config.py                  Data structure - Used to resolve flow file based on project,branch,flow

   flows/                        Holds flow files.  Flow files describe stages and their tasks to run.
      verifier.json              JSON structure defining a flow (.json ext is optional)

   tasks/                        Directory of tasks (executable scripts), subdirs are OK
      taskA
      taskB
      foo/taskA

   profiles/                     When started via flowb.sh we can source profiles
      profile.flowb              Always sourced
      profile.<project>

[Outputs]

   <USER_LAUNCH_DIR>/            Directory where user launched from

      results/                   Created by flowb
         output/                 Global output directory - All tasks and stages can use (helpful for linking tasks)
         <stage_name_A>          Stage name found in flow file
            output/              Output directory for the stage
         <stage_name_B>          (...)
            output/              (...)
